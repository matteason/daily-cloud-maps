# Daily cloud maps 
<img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/matteason/daily-cloud-maps?label=Latest%20map%20date">
This project creates and hosts daily cloud maps based on NASA data for use in 3D modelling software like Blender or Xplanet, or in 2D graphics.

## Frequency & availability
Images are updated once a day. The release tagged `latest` is refreshed daily, so if you configure your software to
use `https://github.com/matteason/daily-cloud-maps/releases/download/latest/[FILENAME]` you'll always stay up-to-date.

You can download historic images from this project's [Releases](https://github.com/matteason/daily-cloud-maps/releases), or
`https://github.com/matteason/daily-cloud-maps/releases/download/[YYYY-MM-DD]/[FILENAME]` - for example,
`https://github.com/matteason/daily-cloud-maps/releases/download/2022-07-27/8192x4096-clouds.jpg`.

I can't guarantee the availability of any particular image; source data may not be available for a particular day if
there's an issue with the satellites. I may also need to eventually delete historic images on a rolling basis if GitHub
get cross with how much space they take up, so keep your own copy of anything important.
If that might affect you, please watch this repo's Issues and I'll let you know if that happens.

## Available images
The following images are created daily. All images are available in four resolutions; replace `[W]x[H]` in the filenames below.

The images shown are the latest images generated and refresh every day.

### Cloud map: `[W]x[H]-clouds.jpg`

## Limitations
The generated images have some limitations due to the source data.

### Poles
The satellites tend not to capture the South Pole. To avoid harsh edges, a static image based on
[Blue Marble Clouds](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/57747/blue-marble-clouds) is overlaid on the bottom
quarter of the live cloud map. This region isn't very visible on 3D images anyway, and most of the area is covered by
the ice cap which makes the clouds even less visible.

### Holes
Occasionally, the satellites capturing the source data will miss some regions. These areas will appear as square-ish
holes without clouds.

### Discontinuities
Because the satellites orbit the Earth, different regions are captured at different times. Sometimes when adjoining
regions are captured at different times, an edge is visible due to the clouds moving between captures.
