This project creates and hosts daily cloud maps based on NASA data for use in 3D modelling software like Blender or Xplanet, or in 2D graphics.

**TL;DR: If you need a high-res greyscale almost-live cloud map, use this URL:**

## Frequency & availability
Images are updated once a day. The release tagged `latest` is refreshed daily, so if you configure your software to
use `https://github.com/matteason/daily-cloud-maps/releases/download/latest/[FILENAME]` you'll always stay up-to-date.

You can download historic images from this project's [Releases](https://github.com/matteason/daily-cloud-maps/releases), or
`https://github.com/matteason/daily-cloud-maps/releases/download/[YYYY-MM-DD]/[FILENAME]` - for example,
`https://github.com/matteason/daily-cloud-maps/releases/download/2022-07-27/8192x4096-clouds.jpg`.

I can't guarantee the availability of any particular image; source data may not be available for a particular day if
there's an issue with the satellites. I may also need to eventually delete historic images on a rolling basis if GitHub
get cross with how much space they take up, so keep your own copy of anything important.
If that might affect you, please watch this repo's Issues and I'll let you know if that happens.

Unfortunately, because GitHub doesn't allow [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) on release assets you won't be able to use the images directly in JavaScript. You can either run a server-side process to download the image and serve it to your JavaScript, or find a CORS proxy that will do that and add the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header for you.

## Available images
<img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/matteason/daily-cloud-maps?label=Latest%20map%20date">

### Specular map: `[W]x[H]-specular.jpg`

![A flat map of Earth with clouds and the Earth's surface in black and the sea in white](https://github.com/matteason/daily-cloud-maps/releases/download/latest/1024x512-specular.jpg)

You can use this specular map to make your model more realistic by only showing specular highlights on bodies of water:

## Limitations
The generated images have some limitations due to the source data.

### Poles
The satellites tend not to capture the South Pole. To avoid harsh edges, a static image based on
[Blue Marble Clouds](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/57747/blue-marble-clouds) is overlaid on the bottom
quarter of the live cloud map. This region isn't very visible on 3D images anyway, and most of the area is covered by
the ice cap which makes the clouds even less visible.

### Holes
Occasionally, the satellites capturing the source data will miss some regions. These areas will appear as square-ish
holes without clouds.

![Crop of a greyscale cloud map with large black squares in areas where cloud data is missing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1935173/182649721-f5e3b26c-22a7-4ed8-b7a5-b65cf583fdd8.png)


### Discontinuities
Because the satellites orbit the Earth, different regions are captured at different times. Sometimes when adjoining
regions are captured at different times, an edge is visible due to the clouds moving between captures.

## Bonus info for nerds (how the maps are generated)

These cloud maps are generated using two NASA data sources, accessed via the [GIBS API](https://nasa-gibs.github.io/gibs-api-docs/available-visualizations/): 'Clear Sky Confidence' and 'Corrected Reflectance (True Color)', both captured by NOAA-20 / VIIRS. You can [view these data layers on the NASA Worldview visualiser](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-270.1391960697406,-154.09671113588468,316.86333361735933,147.4299789182311&l=VIIRS_NOAA20_Clear_Sky_Confidence_Day(max=0.93),VIIRS_NOAA20_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor,VIIRS_SNPP_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden)&lg=false&t=2022-07-24-T00%3A00%3A00Z).

![A map of where the earth is cloudy, ranging from dark red (no clouds) to cream (definitely clouds)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1935173/181494480-8203d42b-4484-4a76-8a45-8ecd8acd7e4c.png)
![A realistic map of the Earth with clouds over it](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1935173/181494550-5e3b552d-f28a-466d-826d-98750b1b714b.png)

You may be wondering why you can't just use the true colour image directly - and you can, but because the satellites capture the earth in vertical strips, you end up with multiple specular reflections on the sea:

![A 3D rendering of Earth. It appears to have highlights in multiple places, as if there are multiple suns](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1935173/181495433-f4e382ed-3dd4-4a55-8fc0-df8094904b86.png)

So we take the clear sky confidence and use it to mask the true colour image pixel-by-pixel by taking the confidence map pixel value, converting it to a confidence from 0.0 to 1.0 (how likely is it that the Earth is obscured by clouds?) and multiplying the pixel value of the true-colour image by that confidence. This means we retain the details from the true-colour image in the generated map. The result is then converted to greyscale to remove any residual colour from land or sea showing through the clouds.
